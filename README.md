# Marketing-Sales-Performance_Power-BI
## I. Introduction
This project involves analyzing sales data from a company called Superstore. The dataset consists of three tables:
- **Orders:** Contains transaction details.
- **People:** Includes information about sales representatives by region.
- **Returns:** Tracks transactions that were returned.

The goal is to create a Power BI dashboard that gives senior management insights into the company’s business performance. This will help them develop strategies for market expansion and identify key growth products.
